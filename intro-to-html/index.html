  <h1>My Cats</h1>
  <hr>
  <h3>I currently have 3 cats. The oldest is black, the middle is orange, and the youngest is mostly brown.</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>
    I have owned a total of 5 cats in my life.
    All of my cats names in order from oldest to youngest are:
  <ul>
    <li>Toonce</li>
    <li>Luna</li>
    <li>Neptune</li>
    <li>Mister</li>
    <li>Astro</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    My pets usually have celestial names, but Toonce and Mister are outliers because we adopted them from outside.
    <br>
    Toonce was named after a skit from Saturday Night Live. "Mister" was originally a temporary name, but it stuck.
