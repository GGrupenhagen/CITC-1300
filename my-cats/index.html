  <h1>My Cats</h1>
  <hr>
  <h3>My cats in order from oldest to youngest are:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Neptune</li>
    <li>Mister</li>
    <li>Astro</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    My pets usually have celestial names, but Mister is an outlier because we adopted him from outside.
    <br>
    "Mister" was originally a temporary name, but it stuck.
  </p>
  <h2>About the cats</h2>
  <p>
    Neptune is very friendly but sometimes isn't in the mood for attention. He is a very relaxed cat.
    <br>
    Neptune will occasionally play with toys and always wants to go outside. We don't let him outside in fear he can't
    defend himself.
    <br>
    <br>
    Mister can be sometimes afraid or skittish, but enjoys being pet a lot if you approach him slowly. He is very active
    outside, but just sleeps when inside.
    <br>
    Mister was either a stray or feral cat from outside, so he enjoys hunting small rodents. He often leaves at night
    but comes back every morning.
    <br>
    <br>
    Astro is extremely clingy and dislikes not being near someone. He is very active and curious.
    <br>
    Astro frequently plays with toys by himself and licks the other cats.
